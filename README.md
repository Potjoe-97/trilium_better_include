# trilium_better_include
Make subnotes and include them faster

### HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT

1. Go into a text note

2. Select some text that starts with a title (h2,h3,h4, etc.)

- Be aware that each title is a delimiter for the script, it means that, if you have a structure like :
——————
## Title
Some text here

## Another title
Another text
——————
Then it will create 2 different subnotes.

Of course, it works even on a single "title — text" structure.

3. Use the script with the shortcut  : alt + w

Keep in mind that it's just a faster workaround to cutIntoNote + includeNote, because you can cut a lot of subnotes and include them immediately which was what I needed, so I made it.

BTW just ignore my french comments, I'm too lazy to remove them or to translate them…
