# trilium_better_include
*Make subnotes and include them faster*

The purpose of this script is to divide our note - which can be seen as a molecule - into several atoms that we can reuse in other contexts later.

## How to use the script

Just drag & drop better_include.js in your Trilium Workspace and run the script in a text note (shortcut : alt + w).
